If you have a history of bleeding problems, you will be asked additional questions. If your blood does not clot normally, you should not donate since you may have excessive bleeding where the needle was placed. For the same reason, you should not donate if you are taking any "blood thinner" such as:


- Atrixa (fondaparinux)
- Coumadin (warfarin)
- Eliquis (apixaban)
- Fragmin (dalteparin)
- Heparin
- Jantoven (warfarin) 
- Lovenox (enoxaparin)
- Pradaxa (dabigatran)
- Savaysa (edoxaban)
- Warfilone (warfarin)
- Xarelto (rivaroxaban)


If you are on aspirin, it is OK to donate whole blood. However, you must be off of aspirin for at least 2 full days in order to donate platelets by apheresis.  For example, if you take aspirin products on Monday, the soonest you may donate platelets is Thursday. Donors with clotting disorder from Factor V who are not on anticoagulants are eligible to donate; however, all others must be evaluated by the health historian at the collection center.
